I had to work through all the lessons in Module 2: What is JavaScript? and complete the following questions to successfully complete the module:

1. What do ES5, ES6 and ES2015 mean - and what are the differences between them?
2. What are JScript, ActionScript and ECMAScript - and how do they relate to JavaScript?
3. What is an example of a JavaScript specification - and where can you find it?
4. What are v8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra and Tamarin? Do they run JavaScript differently?
5. Show a practical example using caniuse.com and the MDN compatibility table.

I used different links for research purposes.
